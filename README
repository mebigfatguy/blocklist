BlockList is an implementation of java.util.List that uses static sized blocks to store items, such that inserts and deletes from the middle of the list only incur a blocksize shuffling penalty.

BlockList never needs reallocations of existing element arrays, nor does it suffer from the one massive array running out of memory, problem.

Getting a value at an index is much faster than linked list, but marginally slower than ArrayList.
